AI Composed Instrumental Music. 

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the most iconic composers of the romantic era, died shortly after debuting his 6th symphony.

### The Goal: Compose Tchaikovsky’s 7th. 

# Motivation and Approach
I want to start by acknowledging the inherent controversy in the goal. Composing the follow-up symphony to one of classical music’s greatest composers raises many questions. Not only would the output be under close scrutiny as to whether it could’ve actually been composed by Tchaikovsky, but is it even allowed to attempt such a feat? One of classical music’s greatest flaws is its finiteness, because the artists are unable to continue creating work the genre has been completed. If/when AI reaches the point of being able to mimic the styles of the greatest composers, can we actually move the genre forward more than century after it ended? Pyotr aims to be that.

### Why Tchaikovsky? 
Being a composer of the late romantic, Tchaikovsky was part of classical music’s departure from the formal structures of the Baroque and Classical eras, making his music arguably more “human.” The works of Bach and Mozart have been able to be imitated by current NLP models and very well with the latest Transformer models
